# Car_prediction
This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning algorithms. Specifically, I implemented a Decision Tree Regressor model in Python for this purpose. Additionally, I created both a Linear Regression model and a Random Forest model to train on the dataset and make accurate predictions for future car prices
